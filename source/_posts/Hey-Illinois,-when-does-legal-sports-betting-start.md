#  Hey Illinois, when does legal sports betting start?

After a long wait, Illinois residents may be able to place legal sports bets within the next few months. The state has been working on the regulations for legalizing sports betting since May, and those are now almost finalized.

So, when can Illinois residents start betting on sports?

The earliest possible date would be in September, but it’s more likely that it will be closer to November or December. The Illinois Gaming Board is still reviewing the regulations, and there could be some changes before they’re finalized.

Once the regulations are finalized, the board will need to award licenses to casinos and other gambling establishments. Once those establishments have their licenses, they will need to implement the gaming systems and train their employees. So there are several steps that need to take place before people can actually start placing bets.

But assuming that everything goes according to plan, Illinois residents should be able to bet on sports by the end of the year.

So what can people bet on?

The regulations allow for betting on all professional and college sports, as well as eSports. There will likely be a variety of betting options available, including point spreads, moneylines, and over/unders. And of course, there will be lots of prop bets available as well.

How much can people win?

This depends on the betting establishment. Some may cap winnings at $5,000 per day or $20,000 per week, while others may have higher limits. But generally speaking, people should be able to win quite a bit if they hit a big winning bet.

Are there any age restrictions?

Yes, you must be at least 21 years old in order to place a bet. This is in line with most other states that have legalized sports betting.

So what are the odds of Illinois legalizing sports betting?


At this point it seems pretty likely that Illinois will legalize sports betting within the next few months. The state has been working on the regulations for quite some time now, and all indications are that they’re close to finalizing them. Once the regulations are finalized and licenses are awarded, it shouldn’t take too long for gambling establishments to get up and running. So we should see legal sports betting in Illinois by the end of the year at the latest.

#  The wait is almost over for legal sports betting in Illinois!

After years of debate and discussion, the Illinois legislature has finally reached a consensus on how to legalize sports betting in the state. The new law should go into effect by the end of the year, making Illinois the latest state to offer legalized sports betting.

The new law will allow casinos and racetracks in Illinois to offer sports betting, with online and mobile platforms also becoming available in the near future. Bettors will be able to place bets on a variety of sporting events, including professional and college football, basketball, baseball, and hockey.

One interesting wrinkle in the new law is that it will allow for so-called "fantasy" sports contests to be offered alongside traditional sports betting. This means that bettors will be able to wager on things like whether or not a certain player will score more points than another player over the course of a game.

Supporters of the new law say that it will help generate much-needed revenue for the state government, while also providing a new form of entertainment for residents. Opponents argue that the law could lead to widespread gambling addiction, and that it could damage the integrity of America's favorite pastimes.

Only time will tell how successful legalized sports betting ultimately proves to be in Illinois. In any event, it's sure to provide a major boost to the state's casino and racing industries.

#  Illinois set to join the growing list of states with legal sports betting

Illinois is on the verge of becoming the sixth state in the U.S. to legalize sports betting, following a vote by the state's House of Representatives on Tuesday.

The proposal now heads to the desk of Governor J.B. Pritzker, who has indicated that he will sign it into law. It would then become effective 90 days later.

Under the proposed legislation, sportsbooks would be able to offer bets on individual games as well as futures and prop bets. The bill also allows for online and mobile betting, which is expected to account for the majority of sports betting market in Illinois.

The Land of Lincoln would join a growing list of states that have legalized sports betting in recent years, including Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi. Delaware was the first state to offer legal sports betting in 1976, but only offered parlay cards at that time.

#  When can Illinois residents start legally betting on sports?

There is no set date, but Illinois residents likely won’t be able to place sports bets until the second half of 2019. In May 2018, the US Supreme Court overturned a 1992 federal law that barred states from legalizing sports betting. This ruling allowed each state to decide whether or not to legalize sports betting.

The Illinois General Assembly passed a bill legalizing sports betting in June 2019. The bill allows for on-site and online sports betting. The bill also establishes the Illinois Gaming Board to regulate and enforce sports betting rules.

The Illinois Gaming Board has not yet released regulations for sports betting. It is likely that the Board will release regulations in late fall or early winter. Once the Board releases regulations, Illinois residents will be able to place sports bets at approved locations.

There are many potential locations for Illinois residents to place sports bets. These include casinos, race tracks, off-track betting facilities, and online gambling sites. It is likely that only a few of these locations will offer live betting, where bettors can watch sporting events and place bets in real time.

It is still unclear how much tax revenue legalized sports betting will generate for Illinois government coffers. However, it is expected that legalized sports betting will bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes each year. This money will be used to fund education and other important programs in the state budget.
