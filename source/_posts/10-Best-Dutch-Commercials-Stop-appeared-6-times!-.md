#  Why Are Dutch Commercials So Funny? The Stop Commercial is a Classic 

Commercials in the Netherlands are famously funny. But why? Some say it's because the Dutch are masters of satire, and use humor to make a point. Others say that the Dutch commercials are just funnier than those in other countries. Here are some of the most famous Dutch commercials, complete with English subtitles.

First is the "Stop Commercial," which has been viewed over 7 million times on YouTube. It's a spoof of those public service announcements that tell you to "stop" doing something bad. In this commercial, a man is driving a car and sees a speed limit sign that says "130." He immediately breaks out into a fit of laughter, knowing that he can go much faster than that. The tagline is "Just keep driving."

The next commercial is for Koningsdag (King's Day), a national holiday in the Netherlands. It features people dressed up in orange clothes and celebrating on the street. The tagline is "One day each year, we're all Dutch."

Another popular commercial is for the beer brand Bavaria. It features two women sitting at a bar, and one of them starts to undress her shirt. The other woman gets offended and says "Hey! This is Bavaria!" The tagline is "Forget about Heineken."

Finally, there's this commercial for Albert Heijn, a supermarket chain in the Netherlands. It shows people shopping for food and trying to figure out what to make for dinner. The tagline is "Albert Heijn: We have everything you need."

#  How the Stop Commercial Became a Viral Hit in the Netherlands 

It was 8:30 on a Thursday morning in the Netherlands, and Jolanda was on her way to work. She switched on Radio 538 to hear her favourite DJ, Giel Beelen, when she heard something that made her stop in her tracks. The song "Stop Commercial" by De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig was playing.

A few weeks earlier, Jolanda had seen a music video for the song on YouTube. It showed three young men rapping about how much they hate commercials. Jolanda loved the song's message and its beat, so she shared it with her friends on social media.

Now, here it was on the radio. Jolanda quickly called her friends to ask if they were listening too. They all confirmed that they were and that they loved the song as well.

The next day, "Stop Commercial" was at the top of the Dutch charts. It stayed at number one for six weeks and became the most-played song on Dutch radio in 2018.

So what made "Stop Commercial" such a hit in the Netherlands? Some say it's because the song's message is so relevant today. With so many commercials bombarding us every day, it's no surprise that people are looking for ways to fight back.

Others say that people love the song because it's fun and catchy. The rap lyrics are easy to sing along to, and the beat is upbeat and danceable. Whatever the reason, there's no doubt that "Stop Commercial" is one of the biggest hits in the Netherlands right now.

#  The Story Behind the Infamous Stop Commercial in the Netherlands 

In 1988, a commercial by the Stop dé voedselverspilling campaign in the Netherlands aired, featuring a woman cutting open a piece of meat to show how much of it was being wasted. The ad quickly became infamous for its graphic and confronting images, but also sparked a national conversation about food waste that still continues today.

The commercial starts with a close-up shot of a piece of raw meat, followed by a cut to reveal that more than half of it has been wasted. The woman narrating the ad then says “This is how much schnitzel we throw away in the Netherlands every day” as she slices off another chunk of meat. The camera zooms in on the discarded flesh as the narrator says “This is an outrage. We’re talking about millions of euros worth of good meat going to waste.” 

Throughout the commercial, there are recurring shots of meat being thrown away as the narrator condemns supermarket chains for contributing to food waste. She ends by calling on viewers to shop at local markets where they can buy fresh produce instead. 

The Stop dé voedselverspilling campaign was started in response to the worsening food waste situation in the Netherlands. In 1986, it was estimated that supermarkets were wasting around 40,000 tonnes of food each year, and by 1988 that figure had grown to 60,000 tonnes. In comparison, the total amount of food wasted by households was around 9,000 tonnes per year. 

Supermarkets were discarding perfectly edible food for a number of reasons: outdated stock that couldn’t be sold; cosmetic defects such as bruises or blemishes; and unable to meet strict sell-by dates. Most shoppers assumed that if a product had passed its sell-by date, it was no longer safe to eat, so they would avoid buying anything that looked like it might have been close to expiring. 

The Stop dé voedselverspilling campaign aimed to change this mindset by educating consumers about the importance of using sell-by dates as guidance rather than gospel. They also wanted supermarkets to do more to reduce their food waste levels, such as selling unpackaged products so shoppers could see what they were buying, and donating surplus food to charities or soup kitchens. 

The commercial caused quite a stir when it first aired, with some people praising it for bringing attention to an important issue while others felt it was too graphic and offensive. Regardless of people’s opinions on the ad itself, it put food waste firmly on the public agenda and encouraged more discussion about ways to reduce its impact. 

Since then, campaigns against food waste have continued in the Netherlands and other countries around the world. In recent years there has been increasing focus on preventing unnecessary food production and consumption – otherwise known as ‘food miles’ – as well as recovering edible foods from landfill sites before they decompose and release harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 

So far these efforts have shown some promising results, but there is still much work to be done if we want to make significant reductions in global food waste levels. The story behind the infamous Stop commercial reminds us that progress can be slow but steady if we keep raising awareness and working together towards common goals.
