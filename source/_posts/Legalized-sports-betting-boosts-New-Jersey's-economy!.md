#  Legalized sports betting boosts New Jersey's economy!

The recent legalization of sports betting in New Jersey has been a boon to the state's economy, with tax revenue from wagers totaling more than $16 million in the first six months since the law took effect in June.

This is great news for New Jersey, which has been struggling economically in recent years. The additional revenue will help fund critical infrastructure projects and services, boosting the state's economy and creating jobs.

In addition, the legalization of sports betting has generated significant new interest in gambling, and this is likely to lead to an increase in tourism spending as well. So not only is the legalization of sports betting benefiting the state financially, it is also stimulating economic activity more broadly.

This is a win-win situation for New Jersey and its citizens. The state government is getting much-needed revenue to fund important projects, and residents are enjoying increased tourism and gambling activity. It is clear that the legalization of sports betting has been a great decision for New Jersey, and other states should follow its lead.

#  NJ residents lead the nation in sports betting!

New Jersey residents love their sports, and they love to bet on them too! In fact, according to a recent study by the American Gaming Association, NJ residents account for more sports bets than any other state in the nation.

The study found that in 2017, New Jersey residents placed $1.48 billion in legal sports bets. That’s more than double the amount of the next closest state, Pennsylvania, which had $674 million in bets.

So what’s behind New Jersey’s love of sports betting? One reason could be that New Jersey was one of the states that was allowed to offer legal sports betting after the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban last year.

Since then, a number of casinos and racetracks have opened up their own sportsbooks, including Monmouth Park Racetrack and The Borgata Casino. This has given NJ residents plenty of options when it comes to betting on their favorite teams.

Another reason for the high amount of sports betting in NJ is that the state has a lot of enthusiastic fans. In fact, a 2017 study by Nielsen found that New Jersey was home to more avid NFL fans than any other state in the nation.

So whether you’re a fan of the Giants, Jets, Phillies or any other team, you can place a bet on them at one of New Jersey’s many sportsbooks. Just be sure to stay within the legal limits – it’s illegal to bet on college games or events taking place in other states.

#  Millions wagered on Super Bowl LIII in New Jersey!

In what is being called the biggest betting event in state history, millions of dollars were wagered on the Super Bowl at New Jersey's legal sportsbooks.

$158.6 million was bet in total at the state's seven sportsbooks, with the Patriots' victory leading to a $10.8 million payout. That breaks down to an average of $22,653 wagered on each of the 719 individual bets placed.

The Borgata led all casinos with $72.8 million wagered, while Monmouth Park took in $36.7 million and Ocean Resort took in $10 million. The William Hill sportsbook at Monmouth Park saw the single largest bet in state history - a $1 million wager on the Rams to win straight-up.

"We're absolutely thrilled," said Joe Asher, CEO of William Hill U.S. "This was by far our most successful Super Bowl ever."

New Jersey legalized sports betting in June of 2018, and it has been a boon for the state's casinos and racetracks. In December alone, more than $300 million was wagered on sports in New Jersey, with over $20 million in profits being paid out to winning bettors.

#  More people are betting on sports in NJ than ever before!

According to a report from the state Division of Gaming Enforcement, more people placed sports bets in New Jersey during the month of September than in any other month since the state began taking sports bets in June 2018.

In total, $206.9 million was wagered on sporting events in September, up from $167.1 million in August and $102.3 million in July. The increase is likely due, at least in part, to the start of the NFL season.

The numbers are especially impressive when you consider that New Jersey only accounted for about 10 percent of all sports bets taken nationwide during September. Nevada took in about $2.16 billion in sports bets last month, while Delaware took in about $24 million.

“This is another strong indicator that New Jersey’s regulated sports betting market is thriving and continues to grow each month since launch,” said David Rebuck, director of the Division of Gaming Enforcement.

Sports betting has been a boon for the New Jersey casino industry, with total gaming revenue from casinos up 5 percent in September compared to the same month a year ago. The number of sports bettors has also continued to grow, with nearly 227,000 unique customers placing bets last month.

Despite the strong numbers, not everyone is convinced that sports betting is good for New Jersey. Some lawmakers and opponents of gambling argue that the state should focus on more traditional forms of tourism rather than catering to gamblers.

But for now, it looks like sports betting is here to stay – and New Jersey casinos are reaping the benefits!
