#  Clippers' Big Gamble Pays Off in Game 1!

Coming into the series, there were a lot of questions surrounding the Clippers. Could they make it out of the first round? Would Tobias Harris be able to carry them offensively against the Warriors?

In Game 1, it was clear that the Clippers had something to prove. They came out firing on all cylinders, taking an early lead and never looking back. Tobias Harris was incredible, scoring 36 points on 14-of-20 shooting. The Warriors tried to double team him, but he was too quick and agile for them to keep up.

The rest of the Clippers contributed as well. Lou Williams scored 22 points off the bench, Patrick Beverley had 14 points and 10 assists, and Montrezl Harrell added 12 points and 8 rebounds.

The Clippers' defense was also impressive, holding the Warriors to just 92 points. Stephen Curry only scored 25 points on 9-of-23 shooting, and Kevin Durant was held to 18 points on 6-of-17 shooting.

This was a huge win for the Clippers and a big statement heading into Game 2. If they can continue playing this way, they have a real chance at upsetting the Warriors and making it to the Western Conference Finals.

#  Rivers Knows When to Wager Big Against Golden State

The Golden State Warriors just keep on winning.

At this point, it feels like we’re watching a dynasty in the making. With Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and the rest of that stacked squad, the Warriors are pretty much unbeatable.

Rivers knows this. That’s why he’s been betting big against them – and winning.

The Clippers coach has taken on Golden State 11 times so far this season. And he’s come away with the win six times.

That’s a pretty impressive record. Especially when you consider that Rivers is up against one of the best coaches in the business in Steve Kerr.

What makes Rivers’ record even more impressive is that he’s not just picking games at random here. He’s only betting against the Warriors when he thinks they’re vulnerable.

For example, Rivers refused to bet against Golden State when they faced the Oklahoma City Thunder last month. The Warriors were without Curry and KD was nursing an injury, but Rivers didn’t think they were ripe for an upset. As it turned out, the Thunder lost by over 30 points.

But when Golden State took on the Mavericks a few days later, Rivers decided to lay down some money on Dallas. The Warriors only won by 3 points in that game, proving that Rivers does know when to bet against them after all.

#  Clippers' Win Shows That Timing Is Everything in Gambling 

In any form of gambling, timing is everything. Knowing when to pull the trigger or when to fold can be the difference between winning and losing. The Clippers showed that on Wednesday night when they won an unlikely game against the Golden State Warriors.

The Warriors were up by 14 points with just over four minutes to play and it looked like they were going to coast to an easy win. But the Clippers had other ideas. They went on a 14-0 run to take the lead and ended up winning by three points.

What was so impressive about this comeback was that it wasn't just a one-time thing. The Clippers have now won eight of their last 10 games and are currently in sixth place in the Western Conference. This is a team that was expected to be one of the worst in the league this year, but they continue to surprise people.

So what is behind this sudden turnaround? A lot of it has to do with the timing of their shots. The Clippers are shooting 47 percent from the field this year, which is good enough for eighth best in the league. They are also shooting 39 percent from three-point range, which is third best in the league.

This high percentage from three-point range is due in part to the fact that they are getting good looks at the basket. Their shot distribution this year shows that they are taking shots early in the shot clock and are getting good shots late in games as well. This is a testament to their coaching staff's ability to make adjustments and put their players in a position to succeed.

There have been plenty of teams in NBA history that have had hot streaks like this, but what makes the Clippers unique is that they are doing it against some of the best teams in the league. In their last 10 games, they have beaten Golden State, Houston and Oklahoma City twice each. They have also beaten San Antonio and Portland once apiece.

So can they keep this up? The answer is probably not. But that doesn't mean that they can't continue to be a dangerous team heading into playoffs. If they can continue to shoot threes at a high percentage and play lockdown defense, they could make some noise in the postseason.

#  What to Watch For: When to Wager Big in Blackjack 

Many blackjack players are curious about when to make large bets. There is no one definitive answer to this question, but there are a few factors you can keep in mind to help you decide when it’s the right time to wager big.

The first thing to consider is your bankroll. If you have a lot of money to spare, you can afford to make bigger bets and stand to lose more without feeling too much financial pain. However, if you’re on a tighter budget, you may want to wager smaller amounts and save your bigger bets for when the odds are more in your favor.

Another thing to consider is your playing style. Some players prefer to play conservatively and make small bets most of the time; others are more aggressive and like to bet bigger when they have a good hand. Knowing which type of player you are will help you determine how much risk you’re comfortable taking on.

In general, it’s usually a good idea to bet big when the odds are in your favor. This means making larger wagers when the dealer has a low card up (2 through 6), when you have a Blackjack, or when the deck is favorable (i.e. there are more low cards left). Conversely, you should generally wager smaller amounts when the dealer has a high card up (7 through Ace), when you don’t have Blackjack, or when the deck isn’t as favorable.

If you’re not sure whether it’s worth betting big, remember that it’s always better to err on the side of caution and make smaller bets instead of risking too much money. However, if the conditions are right and you feel confident about your chances, go ahead and put down that big wager – but make sure you know what you’re doing!

#  Clippers Win Despite Poor Play; When to Wager Big in Blackjack a Crucial Factor

The Los Angeles Clippers won on Wednesday night against the Sacramento Kings, 112-108, despite playing poorly for most of the game. The victory brings their record to 3-2 on the young season. This is a team that many believe can challenge the Golden State Warriors for supremacy in the Western Conference.

There are some key takeaways from this game. One is that even when the Clippers play poorly, they have enough talent to win. Another takeaway is that when it comes to blackjack, it’s important to wager big in order to maximize your chances of winning.

In blackjack, it’s important to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. If you go over 21, you lose automatically. The goal is to get two cards with a total value of 21, which is called a blackjack. If you don’t get a blackjack, the next highest hand is an Ace and a 10, which is called a “natural.”

The Clippers got off to a slow start on Wednesday night, scoring only 22 points in the first quarter. They were down by as many as 12 points in the second quarter, but they managed to come back and win the game. This was due largely to their ability to score in the fourth quarter. They outscored the Kings by 18 points in the final period.

Blake Griffin led the way for the Clippers with 27 points and 10 rebounds. Chris Paul added 25 points and 10 assists. DeAndre Jordan had 19 points and 20 rebounds. The Kings were led by Rudy Gay, who scored 28 points.

This was a much-needed win for the Clippers after losing their season opener against the Lakers. They will look to build on this win when they take on the Phoenix Suns on Friday night.
