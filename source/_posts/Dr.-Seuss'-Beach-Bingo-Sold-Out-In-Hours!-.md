#  Dr. Seuss' Beach Bingo Sold Out In Hours! 

It was announced Tuesday that Dr. Seuss' Beach Bingo has sold out in hours!

"We are absolutely thrilled that families are embracing this new Dr. Seuss title," said Carrie Schultz, senior director of marketing for Random House Children's Books. "What could be more perfect for summer reading fun than a board game with Dr. Seuss' wacky wordplay and whimsical art?"

The beach-themed game, which was published on June 5, is based on the classic tale "Oh, the Places You'll Go!" Players race to fill their boards with images depicting a sun-drenched vacation by collecting cards as they travel along a game board resembling a striped beach towel.

The game is recommended for ages 8 and up, and can be played with two to four players. It retails for $25.

The announcement of the sell-out comes as no surprise to those who have been following the popularity of Dr. Seuss titles in recent years. In fact, three of his books—"Green Eggs and Ham," "The Cat in the Hat" and "One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish"—were recently named among the top 10 best-selling children's books of all time.
