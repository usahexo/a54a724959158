            <h1 id="Why-didn’t-Manchester-United-sign-Hugo-in-the-summer-transfer-window"><a href="#Why-didn’t-Manchester-United-sign-Hugo-in-the-summer-transfer-window" class="headerlink" title="Why didn’t Manchester United sign Hugo in the summer transfer window?"></a>Why didn’t Manchester United sign Hugo in the summer transfer window?</h1><p>Manchester United were in the market for a new goalkeeper in the summer transfer window, with David De Gea’s future at the club in doubt. However, they failed to sign Hugo Lloris from Tottenham Hotspur, with the Frenchman instead choosing to stay at Spurs.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why United didn’t sign Hugo in the summer. Firstly, they may have been put off by Tottenham’s asking price for the goalkeeper. Spurs were reportedly demanding £50 million for Hugo, which may have been too expensive for United.</p>
<p>Another factor which may have played a role in Manchester United not signing Hugo is that he had just signed a new contract with Spurs until 2022. This may have meant that United would have had to pay over the odds to get him and they may have decided that it wasn’t worth it.</p>
<p>Finally, David De Gea may have played a part in Manchester United not signing Hugo. If De Gea had decided to leave United, they would have needed a new goalkeeper and they may have decided that it was more important to sign someone like De Gea rather than Hugo.</p>
