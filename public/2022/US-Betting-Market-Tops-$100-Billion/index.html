            <h1 id="US-Betting-Market-Tops-100-Billion"><a href="#US-Betting-Market-Tops-100-Billion" class="headerlink" title="US Betting Market Tops $100 Billion"></a>US Betting Market Tops $100 Billion</h1><p>The legal betting market in the United States was worth more than $100 billion in 2017, according to a new report from market research firm Allied Market Research. That’s up from just $19.3 billion in 2012, when the firm began tracking the market.</p>
<p>Gambling is now legal in 33 states, and sports betting is especially popular. The report projects that the US betting market will grow to $220.6 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>Nevada has long been the top gambling state in the US, with a market value of $10.9 billion in 2017. But other states are catching up quickly. New Jersey, home to Atlantic City and several racetracks, had a gambling market value of $7.9 billion last year. And Pennsylvania, which legalized casino gambling in 2004, had a gambling market value of $6.2 billion last year.</p>
<p>The growth of online gambling is helping to drive the expansion of the US betting market. In 2017, online gambling revenues reached $4.5 billion, up from just $1.5 billion in 2012.</p>
<p>The report found that millennials are driving much of the growth in the US betting market. They account for more than half of all gamblers in the US and account for two-thirds of all online gambling revenues.</p>
<h1 id="3-4-5-US-Betting-Market-to-Grow-to-150-Billion-in-2020"><a href="#3-4-5-US-Betting-Market-to-Grow-to-150-Billion-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="3.4.5.US Betting Market to Grow to $150 Billion in 2020"></a>3.4.5.US Betting Market to Grow to $150 Billion in 2020</h1><p>According to the latest report from market research firm Technavio, the betting market in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 5% during the forecast period and reach a value of $150 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>The increasing popularity of fantasy sports, advancement in online betting platforms, and legalization of gambling in some states are the key factors driving growth in this market. In addition, the increasing number of bettors and rise in disposable income are also contributing to market growth.</p>
<p>“The growth in the US betting market can be attributed to advancements in online betting platforms that have made it easier for people to place bets online. In addition, the legalization of gambling in some states has also provided a boost to this market,” says Faisal Ghaus, Vice President of Technavio.</p>
<p>The fantasy sports segment accounted for more than 60% of the total betting market revenue in 2015 and is expected to grow at a CAGR exceeding 6% during the forecast period. This segment is growing rapidly due to the increase in the number of participants, especially millennials. Fantasy sports allow users to create virtual teams composed of real players from professional or collegiate leagues and compete against other users for points based on their players’ individual or team performances.</p>
<p>The online betting segment is also anticipated grow at a high rate during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the increasing use of mobile devices for placing bets and advancements in streaming technology that offer better user experience. In 2015, this segment accounted for over 30% share of the total betting market revenue.</p>
<p>However, there are some factors that could hamper growth in this market. One such factor is strict regulations by state governments on gambling activities, which could impact demand for betting services and products. Another restraining factor is social stigma associated with gambling, which deters some people from participating in this market.</p>
